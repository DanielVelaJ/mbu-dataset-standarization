"""
Utility Functions for MBU Dataset Standardization

This module contains common helper functions and utilities used throughout
the conversion pipeline. Functions are added as needed - no boilerplate.

# TODO: Add utility functions here as needed during implementation
# Examples of what might be added later:
# - JSONL reading/writing when we need it
# - Image size detection when we need it  
# - Path manipulation helpers when we need them
# - Logging setup when we need it
#
# Keep it simple and implement only what's actually used.
