# Task 11.6: Other-Medical Domain-Specific Templates

## Task Requirements
Read the task 11 general guidelines. 
Then please suggest to me the templates that you would create and the reasoning behind them. Remember to mention what leaf node from our taxonomy you would be using for each template.

Focus on other medical domains not covered by the main specialties, including but not limited to: cell microscopy, biomedical research imaging, veterinary applications, dental imaging, and other specialized medical imaging applications. Consider the unique characteristics and requirements of these diverse medical imaging contexts.
