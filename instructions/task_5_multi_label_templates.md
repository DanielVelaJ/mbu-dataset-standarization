# Task 5: Multi-Label Classification Templates
Similarly to how we did in task 2 for binary classification and task 4 for multi-class classification, we will now create templates for multi-label classification. Please read the context files and the instructions files and help me define the templates. 
These should be the domain-agnostic templates that work across all medical domains. Remember multi-label classification has more than one class and the correct answer is a set of classes. Save them in templates/domain-agnostic/classification/multi-label directory please. 
Let's start with the easy difficulty templates first, think of just 3 templates for now. They must be able to work with the most basic information that is needed for a multi-label classification dataset.

## Progress and Decisions Made

### ✅ Task 5 Completed Successfully

**Three Multi-Label Templates Created** in `templates/domain-agnostic/classification/multi-label/`:

#### **Template 1: Basic Finding Detection** (domain-agnostic_classification_multilabel_easy_1.md)
- **Pattern**: "Which of the following medical findings are present in this {modality} image?"
- **Use Case**: Multiple co-occurring medical conditions or pathological findings
- **Clinical Relevance**: Mirrors real scenarios where multiple pathologies coexist in single images
- **Example Applications**: CheXpert-style chest X-ray findings, dermatology feature detection, retinal pathology identification

#### **Template 2: Anatomical Structure Identification** (domain-agnostic_classification_multilabel_easy_2.md)  
- **Pattern**: "Which of the following anatomical structures are visible in this {modality} image?"
- **Use Case**: Multiple anatomical structures/organs visible in single image
- **Clinical Relevance**: Tests fundamental anatomical recognition across multiple structures
- **Example Applications**: Multi-organ CT identification, retinal structure assessment, histopathology tissue typing

#### **Template 3: Clinical Assessment with Multiple Criteria** (domain-agnostic_classification_multilabel_easy_3.md)
- **Pattern**: "Which of the following {assessment_type} are present in this {modality} image?"
- **Use Case**: Multiple clinical criteria, quality assessment, or diagnostic features
- **Clinical Relevance**: Systematic clinical evaluation following established assessment protocols
- **Example Applications**: Image quality assessment, ABCDE criteria for skin lesions, BI-RADS mammography features

### **Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Domain-Agnostic Approach**: All templates work across medical specialties with minimal dataset requirements
2. **Easy Difficulty Focus**: Designed for straightforward multi-label classification accessible to basic models
3. **Set-Based Answers**: Templates properly handle multiple correct answers as sets of labels
4. **Clinical Realism**: Questions mirror actual medical diagnostic workflows where multiple findings coexist
5. **Independent Assessment**: Each label is evaluated independently (not mutually exclusive)

### **Template Structure Compliance:**
- ✅ **8-Section Format**: All templates follow standardized structure (Overview, Description, Pattern, Schema, Requirements, Rules, Examples, Notes)
- ✅ **Schema Alignment**: Perfect compliance with unified datum schema v1.0 using "multi_label" answer type
- ✅ **Medical Accuracy**: All examples use correct medical terminology and established clinical standards
- ✅ **Comprehensive Examples**: Each template includes 5 concrete examples across different medical domains

### **Multi-Label Capabilities Addressed:**
- **Multiple Correct Answers**: Templates handle 0, 1, or multiple simultaneous correct labels
- **Independent Labels**: Each finding/structure/criterion assessed independently
- **Negative Cases**: "None of the above" option for images with no target labels
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Enables systematic evaluation of all relevant features

### **Dataset Requirements Defined:**
- **Multi-label structure**: 2+ independent binary labels per image that can co-occur
- **Medical terminology**: Clear finding/structure/criteria names
- **Any imaging modality**: Works with X-ray, CT, MRI, photos, microscopy, etc.
- **Independent assessability**: Each label evaluable regardless of others

### **Clinical Applications Enabled:**
- **Comprehensive Diagnosis**: Multiple co-occurring condition detection
- **Systematic Assessment**: Following clinical protocols with multiple criteria  
- **Quality Control**: Multi-criteria image and clinical assessment
- **Educational Training**: Teaching systematic, comprehensive image analysis

### **Documentation Created:**
- ✅ **README.md**: Comprehensive guide for multi-label template collection
- ✅ **Usage Guidelines**: Clear template selection and implementation best practices
- ✅ **Evaluation Considerations**: Specialized metrics for multi-label classification
- ✅ **Dataset Compatibility**: Examples of compatible multi-label medical datasets

### **Strategic Value Achieved:**
- **Foundation for Multi-Label Evaluation**: Enables comprehensive assessment of multi-label medical AI capabilities
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Templates mirror real multi-factorial medical decision making
- **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Works across all major medical imaging specialties
- **Educational Framework**: Systematic approach to teaching comprehensive medical image analysis
