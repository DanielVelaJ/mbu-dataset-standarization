# Task 12: Create Templates Summary
I need a file that summarizes all the templates that we have created. This file should be in the templates directory and be called templates_summary.md. This file should include the following information:
- The name of the template
- The task type
- The difficulty
- The question pattern
- The answer format
- The answer choices
- The example
- The datasets to which the template is compatible
- The template id
- The template file location and name

It should be hierachically structured by domain and task type mirroring the directory structure in the templates directory. Hoever this must be a light read so that anyone can quickly see al of the templates available. It should be easy to navigate and understand.
Feel free to include tables or lists to make it easier to navigate.

The summary must be up to date with the templates that we have created, please make sure to read all of the templates, do not just rely on the README files.
