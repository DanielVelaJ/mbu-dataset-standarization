# Task 3: Binary Classification Datasets Selection
There is a file in data/dataset_metadata/dataset_metadata.csv that contains all of the dataset metadata for the binary classification datasets. We need to select 3 datasets from this file that are binary classification datasets and that have a high quality scores. Please read the context/about_dataset_metadata so that you understand where the file comes from. From this csv we need to select the best binary classification datasets (we can use the quality score to decide this and the task type to decide this). 

Let's choose them one by one and see how they work with the templates. Give me the list of 3 datasets and the reasons why you chose them.
