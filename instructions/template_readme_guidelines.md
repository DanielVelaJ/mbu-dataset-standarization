Each folder in the templates directory must have a README.md file that explains the templates in the folder as some sort of index as well as why it is there. It should provide an example of how a question is generated from the template. Avoid including boilerplate information and abstain from comments such as "technical excelence" or "validated across..." or "thoroughly tested..." etc. 

Whenever the readme lists a template please make sure to include the question formula and the formula for the answer choices.  
"Is this {modality} image normal or abnormal?"
