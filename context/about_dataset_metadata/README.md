# About dataset metadata
Here we describe all of the context files that are relevant to understand the dataset metadata. 

As part of the mbu project we have gathered metadata for a lot of datasets. This metadata is saved in the data/dataset_metadata directory. We have also created a schema that describes the metadata for all of the datasets. 

1. unified_schema.json
This is a json file that describes the schema of the metadata for all of the datasets that we have gathered as part of the mbu project. The dataset metadata is saved in the data/dataset_metadata directory. 
2. mbu_medical_vision_taxonomy_table.md
This file contains a table that describes the possible tasks that can be assigned to a dataset. 
3. about_metadata_standarization_process.md
This file contains a description of the process of standarizing the metadata for the datasets that was done in a prior stage of the project. The csv in data/dataset_metadata/dataset_metadata.csv is the result of this process, and is filtered to only include the relevant datasets.
