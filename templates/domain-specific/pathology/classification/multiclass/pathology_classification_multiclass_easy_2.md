# Pathology Tissue Type Identification Template

## Template Overview

**Template ID**: `pathology_classification_multiclass_easy_2`  
**Task Type**: Multiclass Classification  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Pattern**: Fundamental tissue type recognition  
**Domain**: Pathology (histopathological imaging)

## Template Description

This template converts multiclass classification datasets into MCVQA format by asking questions about basic tissue types in histopathological images. This fundamental tissue recognition is essential for pathological interpretation, as it provides the foundation for understanding normal anatomy and identifying pathological changes.

The template is designed for pathology datasets where tissues are classified into major histological categories, testing the model's ability to recognize basic tissue architecture and cellular organization patterns.

## Question Generation Pattern

### Question Format
```
"What type of tissue is primarily shown in this histopathological section?"
```

### Answer Format
Multiclass choice with tissue type options:
- A. Epithelial tissue
- B. Connective tissue
- C. Muscle tissue
- D. Nervous tissue
- E. Lymphoid tissue

### Template Variables
- `{tissue_architecture}`: Organizational patterns and structural features
- `{cellular_morphology}`: Cell shapes, sizes, and arrangements
- `{matrix_composition}`: Extracellular matrix and supporting structures
- `{specialized_features}`: Unique characteristics of tissue types

### Clinical Context
- **Epithelial Tissue**: Cell layers, basement membrane, surface or glandular organization
- **Connective Tissue**: Matrix-rich, scattered cells, structural support function
- **Muscle Tissue**: Contractile cells, striated or smooth patterns, elongated morphology
- **Nervous Tissue**: Neurons and supporting cells, specialized cellular processes
- **Lymphoid Tissue**: Immune cells, organized lymphoid structures, hematopoietic elements

## Template Usage Rules

### Question Construction Rules
1. Focus on primary tissue type identification
2. Use standard histological terminology
3. Reference architectural and cellular organizational patterns
4. Maintain consistency with basic histology principles

### Answer Assignment Rules
1. Map surface/glandular structures → "Epithelial tissue"
