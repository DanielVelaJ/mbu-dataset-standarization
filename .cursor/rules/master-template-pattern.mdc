## Master Template Pattern Rule

When creating multiple templates of the same type, ALWAYS follow this pattern:

### 1. Create ONE Master Template First
- Build the first template completely and validate it fully
- Ensure it follows the 6-section format from `instructions/template_guidelines/general_template_guidelines.md`
- Verify MCVQA compliance (single correct answer, multiple choice format)
- Test with real dataset references from `data/dataset_metadata/datasets_metadata.csv`
- Get the structure perfect before creating any additional templates

### 2. Validate the Master Template
- [ ] File exists in correct directory with proper naming convention
- [ ] All 6 sections complete (Overview, Description, Pattern, Requirements, Usage Rules, Examples)
- [ ] Template ID matches filename
- [ ] MCVQA compliance verified (no free text, no multi-label)
- [ ] Exactly 2 examples with real dataset references
- [ ] Image presentation method specified
- [ ] Answer construction process documented
- [ ] Medical terminology accurate

### 3. Use Master as Starting Point
- Copy the validated master template for new templates
- Modify only the specific content (variables, examples, medical domain)
- Keep the structure, format, and section organization identical
- Maintain the same level of detail and completeness

### 4. Mini-Validation Cycles
- After every 3-5 new templates, stop and validate
- Check format consistency against the master
- Verify MCVQA compliance
- Confirm dataset references exist in metadata file

### Key Benefits
- Prevents large-scale rework (like the 79-template format issue in Task 13)
- Ensures consistency across template collections
- Reduces validation failures
- Speeds up template creation once master is established

**Remember**: Implementation first, documentation second. Never claim completion without physical file verification.
